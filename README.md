# hm_analysis_tool #

## Introduction ##
A set of python scripts to analyze homology models computed with MODELLER

**get\_molpdf\.py** \- Extracts the MODELLER MOLPDF score from a set of PDB files and print it to a text file\. For usage type: `get_molpdf.py -h`\
**check\_molpdf\_conv\.py** \- From the file generated by get\_molpdf\.py generates plots of score per model (sorted by model number and by score) and of the running RMSD of the score\ For usage type: `check_molpdf_conv.py -h`\
**extract\_str\.py** \- Extract all PDB files with a score below a threshold or a given % of the lowest scored structures\. For usage type: `extract_str.py -h`

## Installation ##
Clone the repo and install it.\
`git clone https://github.com/vanessa-leone/hm_analysis_tool.git`\
`pip install -e .`

## Future features ##
*  Analyze a sugroup of structures further:
	- ProQ/ProQM scores
	- Molprobilty quality check
	- PROCHECK quality check
